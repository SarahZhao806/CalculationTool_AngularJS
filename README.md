# CalculationTool_AngularJS

## This project creates a web tool that calculates and converts results for users.
## In this project, the calculator will help webpage visitors calculate their energy savings from switching to efficient LED and CFL light bulbs. 

### This project involves building the main HTML page, creating the form elements, styling the layout with CSS, and performing calculations on the input using JavaScript and AngularJS's data binding elements.
### I also adjust the layout to display better on small screens and mobile devices.
